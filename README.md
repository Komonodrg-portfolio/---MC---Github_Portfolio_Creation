# 🌐 Building a GitHub Portfolio Website

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents how I built my **personal portfolio website** using **GitHub** as the hosting and version control platform.  

The goal is to not only create an engaging and professional site, but also to **showcase best practices** in using GitHub for portfolio building — from repository organization and README design to leveraging GitHub Pages for deployment.  

This repository serves as both a **live portfolio site** and a **guide for others** who want to create their own.

<em>No one comes in to this world with all the answers.  Like an infant, we must come up to speed through trial and error to strengthen our knowledge base.<br>

Coming back to the US was bittersweet.  Though I missed my wife and kids tremendously while gone, I couldn't shake this feeling to give back to a people who gave so much to us while on our journeys.  Specifically, I thought of the kids in a village where we attended church one Saturday(pic below) and spent a while considering how I best could leverage my talents to help them be all they could aspire to be in this lifetime, despite the extreme hardships felt in remote/rural communities.  My answer and love letter to them and all the lifelong friends met along the way: creating this repo.</em><br>

<b>My Vision:</b><br>
    
- <b>To partner or create a foundation that will provide repurposed/decommissioned cellphones / laptops to individuals in remote area</b>
- <b>Provide scholarships to cover the costs for IT Certifications to individuals showing deep aptitude, skill, and readiness</b><br>

<em>Enjoy these pictures from the trip.
