# 🌐 Building a GitHub Portfolio Website

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents how I built my **personal portfolio website** using **GitHub** as the hosting and version control platform.  

The goal is to not only create an engaging and professional site, but also to **showcase best practices** in using GitHub for portfolio building — from repository organization and README design to leveraging GitHub Pages for deployment.  

This repository serves as both a **live portfolio site** and a **guide for others** who want to create their own.
