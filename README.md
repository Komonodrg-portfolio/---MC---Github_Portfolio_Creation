# 🌐 Building a GitHub Portfolio Website

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents how I built my **personal portfolio website** using **[GitHub](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68dc3dacec4881919e375db2e89b9fc6)** as the hosting and version control platform.  

The goal is to not only create an engaging and professional site, but also to **showcase best practices** in using GitHub for portfolio building — from repository organization and README design to leveraging GitHub Pages for deployment.  

This repository serves as both a **live portfolio site** and a **guide for others** who want to create their own.

<em>The need for a central hub to market your skills is a <b>MUST</b>.  Github is a platform universally known and figured I'd use it, at the very least, because it would efficiently provide my content in a visually pleasing and platform agreeable (PC, Mobile Device) way.<br>
