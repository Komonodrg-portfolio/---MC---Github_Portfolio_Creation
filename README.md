# 🌐 Building a GitHub Portfolio Website

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents how I built my **personal portfolio website** using **GitHub** as the hosting and version control platform.  

The goal is to not only create an engaging and professional site, but also to **showcase best practices** in using GitHub for portfolio building — from repository organization and README design to leveraging GitHub Pages for deployment.  

This repository serves as both a **live portfolio site** and a **guide for others** who want to create their own.

Though pretty tech savy, my experience in <b>Media Creation<b> was in it's infancy.  Leveraging the power of AI, I was able to get pretty current through curiosity and consistency.  Knowing the importance of branding now-adays in a culture where attention spans are diminishing (a gift & a curse of technology in the ease it provides), sometimes it's just not about knowledgability, but visibility.<br>
<br>
While leveling up my experience in my IT professional interests, I felt the need not only to continue my learning journey but to concurrently show how to effectively market yourself.  Given my [mission](https://github.com/Komonodrg-portfolio/Mission/tree/main) for this portfolio repo, I aim to show how went from intially crawling to running towards my career passions. I hope this repo serves as a great benefit to all in their pursuits.<br>
<br> 

Colleages, Onward.
